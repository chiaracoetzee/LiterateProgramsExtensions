This repository hosts MediaWiki extensions (tested against version
1.18.2) that are used to implement the special features of
LiteratePrograms wiki, hosted at http://en.literateprograms.org/.

CodeBlock: does formatting and syntax highlighting for code regions,
including turning noweb links into anchor links between code sections.

DownloadCode: Adds a "Download code" tab that can be used to weave
together the code in an article using noweb and present it as a
downloadable, compilable, source file. Also test-compiles the files
to show compiler errors/warnings.

ShowOnlyTo: A minor extension, used to hide certain text in pages from
users who are not logged in.

They are installed in the conventional manner, by simplying adding to
your LocalSettings.php file:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/CodeBlock/CodeBlock.php" );
require_once( "$IP/extensions/DownloadCode/DownloadCode.php" );
require_once( "$IP/extensions/ShowOnlyTo/ShowOnlyTo.php" );

The noweb tool must be in your path. On Debian/Ubuntu systems you can
simply do:

sudo apt-get install noweb
